## 🎯 What is this?

This repository contains the complete implementation of Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm applications across three cutting-edge domains: optimal experimental design, bioinformatics parameter estimation, and principal curve estimation for big data analysis.

Our work demonstrates the power of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms in solving complex optimization problems across disciplines, with a particular focus on Operations Research methodology and data-driven decision support systems.

> 🔥 **Why Cuckoo Search?** Unlike traditional optimization methods, CS excels at navigating complex, non-convex landscapes with **global search capabilities** and **minimal parameter tuning**. Perfect for real-world problems where gradients don't exist or are unreliable.

## 🌟 Key Applications

### Optimal Experimental Design
- **Challenge**: Find D-optimal exact designs for EMAX models with correlated errors and small sample sizes  
- **Solution**: CS algorithm for locally optimal designs with autoregressive AR(1) covariance structures  
- **Features**: 3–5 observations per subject, efficiency evaluation, robustness to parameter misspecification  

### Single-Cell Gene Trajectory Analysis (scGTM)
- **Challenge**: Constrained maximum likelihood estimation for hill-shaped gene expression patterns  
- **Solution**: CS optimization for zero-inflated Poisson models with mixed continuous/discrete parameters  
- **Features**: Interactive R Shiny application, pseudotime modeling, biological pattern classification  

### Principal Curve Estimation
- **Challenge**: Estimate smooth curves through high-dimensional data clouds for dimensionality reduction  
- **Solution**: Metric-based principal curves using CS optimization with multiple distance functions  
- **Features**: 2D/3D visualization, six synthetic scenarios, comparison with classical Hastie–Stuetzle algorithm
